# Building-and-configuration-of-uncomplicated-firewall

Install UFW: Kali doesn’t have it by default, so you add it for easy firewall control.

Check Status: To see if it’s running and what rules are active.

Set Defaults: Block incoming traffic for security, allow outgoing for normal use.

Allow Ports: Open specific ones (like SSH or web) so needed services work.

Enable UFW: Activates the firewall to apply your rules.

Manage Rules: Check, remove, or disable rules to tweak security as needed.
